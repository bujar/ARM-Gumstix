1. What is the entry point address of the program?
 0x82dc

2. What is the name of the first function branched to in the program?
 __libc_start_main

3. What is the key difference between the output of objdump -d(hello-d.txt)
and objdump -D (hello-bigd.txt)
 -d: outputs only sections which are expected to contain instructions.
 -D: outputs all sections whether they are expected to contain instructions or not.

4. Is the interpretation of the instructions under the .rodata section of 
hello-bigd.txt correct? What does this interpretation mean?
 The .rodata section cantains constant, read only data. In this case, 
 it contains the string "Hello World", and the special character "!". 
 This is the correct interpretation and is exactly what we expected to be
 in this section. This data contains the data that needs to be executed in
 our printf instruction.
